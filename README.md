# Programming-Language-Comparisons
Fun wee side project to see if anything interesting pops up from looking at a bunch of different programming languages

**Why - what's the value?**

I'm a ~~Javascript~~ Typescript guy with a light-touch smattering of experiences in other languages, but nothing nearing the in-depth comprehension I have of JS. _I ~~need~~ want more knowledge!_

**How - what's the plan?**

To start: for each of the top n languages (popular/important/historic):
 - Do a teeny write-up to give context around what the language is intended for.
 - Map out how the fundamentals are done:
   - data handling (variables, types, scope)
   - instructions (loops, branches, functions)

After that: don't know! a few options to look into next could be concurrency/parallelism, memory management, error handling, performance, readability, or ecosystem (tooling/community/devX).

**First things first - which languages!**

```
1st Generation: Machine code
2nd Generation: Assembly languages
3rd Generation: More machine-independent and programmer-friendly
4th Generation: Specific to a domain
5th Generation: Problem-solving using constraints, though looking into a couple they are noted as being written in one of the lower-level languages.

Machine Code ___ 1 (    )

A historically significant bunch from the 60s/70s

## Teeny intro write-ups for context

### Assembly (Skipping this in further on steps but doing a wee write-up for funsies)

(an) Assembly language -> machine code -> Computer Architecture - all three are fairly tied together.

One Assembly instruction refers to a specific operation that the processor can perform. Follows that the processor you're working with determines the operations you can perform. Looks like there are 2 general approaches: CISC - complex individual instructions that do multiple things (memory/arithmetic/logic), and RISC - simple individual instructions.

```
CISC architectures/assembly languages
x86: Intel PCs (and AMD?)

RISC architectures/assembly languages
ARM: used on many cell phones and embedded systems
MIPS: IBM CPUs, Apple devices, gaming consoles
```

Maybe one day I'll come back and dig through some assembly instructions. But for now - onwards to the next language!

### FORTRAN 77

FORTRAN was created when punch cards were in use. Modern versions are still popular today. A rough timeline appears to go along the lines of:

1953: FORTRAN proposed as a more practical alternative to assembly  
1957: FORTRAN "Released"? Published?  
1958: FORTRAN II - added subroutines among other things (III added inline assembly)  
1962: FORTRAN IV - the first version standardized by ANSI/ISO  
1966: FORTRAN 66 standard named, essentially IV  
1977: FORTRAN 77 update to the standard. Further updates to the standard were delayed until 90 making 77 the more historically significant version - so going with that to get a taste!   

### ALGOL 60

ALGOL 58
ALGOL 60
ALGOL 68

"Designed by committee where every member tried hard to get their favorite thing in ... lessons learned in hindsight" (computerphile YouTube)

Intended to avoid some of the problems of FORTRAN (what problems specifically?)

Introduced:
 - Code Blocks (Begin ... end) (are these subroutines? Functions?)
 - Nested functions & lexical scope

Wasn't picked up by commercial computing due to a lack of standard I/O - instead it was used to define algorithms.


## Concepts of language design

Things like "Lexical Scope", "Code Blocks", 

### Evaluation strategy - parameter-passing strategy

_pass-by-... and call-by-... appear to be the same thing. Going with pass-by... as it makes more sense to me._

- pass-by-value - "only" the value is passed in, editing the value in the called function won't change it in the caller. Usually done by copying the value to a new location in memory. Sets up a functional-like ability, but for functional languages where values are immutable pass-by-reference achieves the same thing.
- pass-by-reference - the caller passes the reference (a note of where the value/structure is held in memory). Modifications (to the object, or a reassignment of the object) are therefore visible to the caller. More efficient, but harder for programmers to avoid subtle bugs.
- pass-by-sharing - a memory location is passed as in pass-by-reference. Called functions can edit the object at that memory location. But, they cannot change where the ref points.

Pass-by-reference vs Pass-by-sharing (because the difference here seems pretty subtle!)


```python
def modify_data(lst):
    lst.append(4)  # Change the values in the given memory location

def reassign_ref(ref):
    ref = [4, 5, 6]  # Change where the reference points


my_list = [1, 2, 3]

modify_data(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

reassign_ref(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]


```


- pass-by-name
- pass-by-copy-restore
- pass-by-unification
- pass-by-need
- pass-by-reference-parameters
- pass-by-reference-to-const
