# Programming-Language-Comparisons
Fun wee side project to see if anything interesting pops up from looking at a bunch of different programming languages

**Why - what's the value?**

I'm a ~~Javascript~~ Typescript guy with a light-touch smattering of experiences in other languages, but nothing nearing the in-depth comprehension I have of JS. _I ~~need~~ want more knowledge!_

**How - what's the plan?**

To start: for each of the top n languages (popular/important/historic):
 - Do a teeny write-up to give context around what the language is intended for.
 - Map out how the fundamentals are done:
   - data handling (variables, types, scope)
   - instructions (loops, branches, functions)

After that: don't know! a few options to look into next could be concurrency/parallelism, memory management, error handling, performance, readability, or ecosystem (tooling/community/devX).

## Structure of this repo / the contents!

- `./concepts of language design.md` The fundamental attributes I'll attempt to compare across the various languages.
- `./context for each lanague.md` A mini write-up for each language, where it came from, why, interesting stuff!

**First things first - which languages!**

```
1st Generation: Machine code
2nd Generation: Assembly languages
3rd Generation: More machine-independent and programmer-friendly
4th Generation: Specific to a domain
5th Generation: Problem-solving using constraints, though looking into a couple they are noted as being written in one of the lower-level languages.

Machine Code ___ 1 (    )
Assembly _______ 2 (1947) (not digging in here - a bit _too_ deep for me right now)

A historically significant bunch from the 60s/70s
ALGOL __________ 3 (1958)
COBOL __________ 3 (1959)  
Lisp ___________(1958) (which old one? Common Lisp?)
FORTRAN 77 _____ 3 (1977)

Backusâ€“Naur form? (a language to define languages... may come back to this) 

BASIC __________ 3 (1963)
