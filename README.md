# Programming-Language-Comparisons
Fun wee side project to see if anything interesting pops up from looking at a bunch of different programming languages

**Why - what's the value?**

I'm a ~~Javascript~~ Typescript guy with a light-touch smattering of experiences in other languages, but nothing nearing the in-depth comprehension I have of JS. _I ~~need~~ want more knowledge!_

**How - what's the plan?**

To start: for each of the top n languages (popular/important / historic), map out how they do the fundamentals; handle data (variables, types, scope), and instructions (loops, branches, functions).

After that: don't know! a few options to look into next could be concurrency/parallelism, memory management, error handling, performance, readability, or ecosystem (tooling/community/devX).

**First things first - which languages!**
