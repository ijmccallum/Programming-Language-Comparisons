# Programming-Language-Comparisons
Fun wee side project to see if anything interesting pops up from looking at a bunch of different programming languages

**Why - what's the value?**

I'm a ~~Javascript~~ Typescript guy with a light-touch smattering of experiences in other languages, but nothing nearing the in depth comprehensiton I have of JS. _I ~~need~~ want more knowledge!_

**How - what's the plan?**

To start: for each of the top n languages (popular / important / historic), map out how they do the fundamentals; handle data (variables, types, scope), and instructions (loops, branches, functions).

After that: don't know! a few options to look into next could be concurrency/parallelisum, memory management, error handling, performance, readability, ecosystem (tooling/community/devX).

**First things first - which languages!**

Javascript | Python | Rust | Go | C | C++ | C# | Java | R | Scala | PHP | Ruby | FORTRAN | Lisp | COBOL | BASIC | Prolog | Erlang | Perl | Haskell | Pascal | Assembly? | OCaml | Groovy | Swift | MATLAB | Visual Basic
